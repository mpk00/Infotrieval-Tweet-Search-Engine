@SoonerKeith1 @golfluvr13 It might have relied on the player.   I was probably 7ish and me and a friend of mine were pretending to be radio DJ's played records and recorded ourselves on an 8 track.  Only time I remember recording on an 8 track.  It sounded horrible also like the speed was off.

Torn about what?! They’re not children, they are grown adults complicit in a family run crime syndicate. They do everything guilty people do... they lie, they misinform, they operate behind closed doors. They execute their fathers criminal playbook and should be treated as such.

@yrfatfriend So much is relative. At size 22 I feel thinner than at size 28 and at size 16 I actually felt like I could pass for thin although I imagine truly thin people wouldn’t consider me so. Some people seem oblivious as in a size 6 friend who asks me if she looks fat.
1st time I met Hardman I noticed his fingers. Several had been broken and a few fingers pointed in wrong directions. I asked why. He said that's football.
